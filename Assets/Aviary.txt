In the beginning, there was the Great Bird, who in her fecundity laid a million, million shimmering eggs across the empty void of the universe. Look up at them every night and hope for their hatching.

So far, only one has hatched. This one special egg grew into a healthy chick, with feathers like trees, and eyes like oceans, and rivers across her beak. She became our world, over which the Thrice-Blessed Yezid Empire rules with compassionate dominion, under the watch of Her Majesty, the Radiant, Empress Yezida the Third of the Imperial House, blessed be Her name.

According to my supervisor, the Royal Ornithologist, the Honorable Hatice Fatma Hatun, I have been charged with the greatest task in all the palace, may its walls of green marble stand until the end of time. In the coming year, throughout this volume, I shall detail every bird in Her Majesty's Aviary to the best of my observation, knowledge, and research. I must have been born under an auspicious star indeed.

I am no priestess, nor historian, to tell you of the Great Bird and Her virtues. I am only Aysa, a humble scientist. Yet it is obvious to all with eyes that our Empress, Her Majesty, possesses those self-same virtues in Her wisdom, Her foresight, and Her gentle, brave heart.

Thus, though I fear I am inadequate to this task as only a junior ornithologist, I must acccept that Her Majesty knows better than I. It seems that a fellow ornithologist by the name of Cem covets my esteemed task and placement in the court, but if I work hard, surely he will see the error of his envy.

I dedicate this tome of knowledge to the name of Her Majesty, daughter of the Great Bird, overseer of all joy, and her beloved Consort Despina. She is the dove perched on the swords of our nation.

SUMMER

This morning I saw a jellyfish outside my window, so I suppose it must be summer, and thus the first day of my holy task. I could barely sleep. Perhaps I should have started before the sun rose, as Cem was already in the Aviary working when I arrived; nevertheless, I shall surely best him.
