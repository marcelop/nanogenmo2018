In the beginning, there was the Great Bird, who in her fecundity laid a million, million shimmering eggs across the empty void of the universe. Look up at them every night and hope for their hatching.

So far, only one has hatched. This one special egg grew into a healthy chick, with feathers like trees, and eyes like oceans, and rivers across her beak. She became our world, over which the Thrice-Blessed Yezid Empire rules with compassionate dominion, under the watch of Her Majesty, the Radiant, Empress Yezida the Third of the Imperial House, blessed be Her name.

According to my supervisor, the Royal Ornithologist, the Honorable Hatice Fatma Hatun, I have been charged with the greatest task in all the palace, may its walls of green marble stand until the end of time. In the coming year, throughout this volume, I shall detail every bird in Her Majesty's Aviary to the best of my observation, knowledge, and research. I must have been born under an auspicious star indeed.

I am no priestess, nor historian, to tell you of the Great Bird and Her virtues. I am only Aysa, a humble scientist. Yet it is obvious to all with eyes that our Empress, Her Majesty, possesses those self-same virtues in Her wisdom, Her foresight, and Her gentle, brave heart.

Thus, though I fear I am inadequate to this task as only a junior ornithologist, I must acccept that Her Majesty knows better than I. It seems that a fellow ornithologist by the name of Cem covets my esteemed task and placement in the court, but if I work hard, surely he will see the error of his envy.

I dedicate this tome of knowledge to the name of Her Majesty, daughter of the Great Bird, overseer of all joy, and her beloved Consort Despina. She is the dove perched on the swords of our nation.

SUMMER

This morning I saw a jellyfish outside my window, so I suppose it must be summer, and thus the first day of my holy task. I could barely sleep. Perhaps I should have started before the sun rose, as Cem was already in the Aviary working when I arrived; nevertheless, I shall surely best him.

The birds are distraught by the heat, and it seems the whole world must be sunlit. Already I crave the taste of chilled apricot from the Kitchenmaze, but I must fulfill my duties first.

Lesser Slatebird

The Coastal Curious Heron is a long-legged bird with noteworthy yellow feathers. It has conspicuous black eyes. Its cage is uncomfortably small and it contains an arrow.

If you can trust my sister, it doesn't like the new fallen leaf in its cage. It is recognizable by its short call. It's vivacious, if I perceive accurately.

Greater Goldbird

Origin: Aka Tilanasco Dunes

It's a creature with uniform red feathers. It eats Vuesse Bay Albatross. This bird is known by its baleful song.

I loathe its cage, maybe because it contains a lantern. In sandstorms this species must be groomed with a comb.

I dreamed of it last night.

I see an enormous bird, as big as a camel, covered with wild, sand-coloured feathers spangled with blue. It dwells in a steel cage that is laughably large.

If you can trust my friend, it enjoys singing duets with Opexi Quit. Normally the Lesser Brownbird makes an ominous song but when it is calling a mate it makes a blaring squawking. It seems to be hale and hearty. It must be groomed with a paintbrush in high winds.

My grandma told me that the droppings of the Piercing Falcon of Sbanad can be calcified and used for lamp oil.

Hunting Cinnamon Ranger

I see a bird with a round body sheathed in uniform feathers. It appears this bird makes an ominous call when a princess dies, yet I have not heard it. I observe it is currently molting. I see four eggs under a shed feather. The Keepers must come interpret its meaning. Its cage is laughably large and its material is disappointing.

I thought it spoke to me, saying: 'success'.

Dusteagle

It's a bird with a tall body covered with complex feathers. It exchanges gifts of seashells with Long Hole Crow. If you can trust my grandma, the bony fowl's warbling is haunting.

It is kept in a glass cage. It looks to be low-energy. It is fed butterflies against its will frequently.

It plays a kind of sport with Stormydove, throwing cherries, which the monarchy of Aka Tilanasco uses in naming a child.\n\nTHE END
