Perhaps I should have started before the sun rose, as Cem was already in the Aviary working when I arrived; nevertheless, I shall surely best him.\n\nThe birds are distraught by the heat, and it %seems the whole world must be %seasonAdj.

So instead, I shall focus only on my work, not my rumbling stomach.\n\nI hope Her Majesty has not been inconvenienced as the season grows %seasonAdj, as Her peace-prayers are of more importance than mortals can understand. Perhaps the cooks can augment the feast with extra %^seasonIngredient %^seasonDish."

Thankfully, I may focus instead on the birds."

May Cem prove to be a faithful lover, and may Her Majesty smile upon my efforts."
