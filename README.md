# nanogenmo2018

Her Majesty's Aviary is an ornithologist's guide to the (fictional) seasonally rotating collection of birds held by Empress Yezida the Third, the Radiant, the Dove of Yezid. It was created by Tanya X. Short, Marcelo Perez, and G.P. Lackey. However, the version for #nanogenmo is considered an in-progress alpha -- the team intends to continue working on several core improvements before the project is complete.

Currently the source code project requires the paid plugin Odin Inspector. However, with a few modifications it is certainly possible to eliminate this requirement.
